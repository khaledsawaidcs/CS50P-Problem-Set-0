Currently, I have 4 functions that I each put in it's own unique folder. I will be adding 1 more file which will have another function and with that I'll be finishing problem set 0 of CS50P. 

In the einsein folder I have a function that calculates the joules given the mass in the famous equation : E = mc^2.
In the faces folder I have a function that converts noraml smiley emoticons ( ":)" ) into real emojies.
In the playback folder I have a function that takes all spaces and replaces them with "..." to get a sort of effect.
In the Indoor file I have a function that makes all words in the givven string have only lowercases. 

In the main folder I have a test for each and every function I created.
This is the start of my journey on github as well as self-learning code & programming.
